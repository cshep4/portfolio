    "World cup 2018 predictor app, designed for users to correctly predict all the scores for the 2018 world cup to score points, as well as creating mini-leagues to compete with friends.",
    "This is built using the Ionic framework, with back-end APIs written in Kotlin using Spring Boot. The back-end is fully unit tested using TDD and is currently being hosted on Heroku.",
    "The database used to store all the data is using PostgreSQL",
    "A scheduled AWS Lambda function is also used to automatically call an API to update match results, as well as user scores.",
    "Match result data is retrieved from an external API, then used to compare against each user's predictions to assign points.",
    "The app uses adverts to generate revenue. The adverts are provided by Google's Admob service."
  ],
  "note" : "Please note, I have decided to take this app down from the app stores since the World Cup has finished. This is due to switching Heroku and PostgreSQL servers to a free plan, meaning the app wasn't suitable for production anymore. The final user count is 6812.",
