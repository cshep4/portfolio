    "Premier League predictor app designed for users to correctly predict the scores of each match to score points, as well as creating mini-leagues to compete with friends. Users can also check live match scores and stats.",
    "This is built using the Ionic framework, with a distributed back-end written in multiple languages, communicating via gRPC. The back-end is fully unit tested using TDD and is currently being hosted using Kubernetes on Google Cloud Platform.",
    "The database used to store user data, match results and live match stat data is MongoDB. For the 18/19 season PostgreSQL and DynamoDB were used.",
    "Websockets are used to send the live match data automatically to the user's device when the match is in-play. Scheduled AWS Lambda functions are used to automatically check if games are in-play and to retrieve the live data.",
    "A scheduled AWS Lambda function is also used to automatically call an API to update user scores. All match data is retrieved from an external API, the results are then used to compare against each user's predictions to assign points.",
    "The app uses adverts to generate revenue. The adverts are provided by Google's Admob service."

There is sometimes issues with the loading of the app but the makers of this app reacts to this exceptionally when letting them know by email via their website. This is also impressive how they respond to you too and give you updates."
