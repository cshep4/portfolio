    "This is a portfolio website I have created to showcase my personal projects and experience in my career so far. This site is designed to clearly display my abilities as a Software Developer, along with my achievements and projects to date.",
    "Originally started with a basic template I found online which was written in Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript using Bootstrap. I then redeveloped it using Angular 6 and extended it to suit my requirements. This is hosted on Firebase.",
    "There is a small serverless back-end written in Go and hosted using AWS Lambda. This is used for sending emails using the Contact forms, as well as retrieving the number of registered users for certain applications in the Portfolio section.",
    "I have not previously had any experience with Go, however after hearing about its benefits and performance speeds I decided this would be a good language to learn, with this site being an ideal starting point.",
    "Originally the back-end was written as an RPC server, however I eventually decided on a serverless architecture instead hosted on AWS Lambda due to its very low running costs."
